    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm 15 years old. since I'm a kid, I'm interested in coding. I went from hardware (to build a lot of heavy
        projects) to
        very basic electronics and soldering. After this small introduction to electronics, I fell in love with high
        voltage!

        I started with a bad "400kV" aliExpress high voltage module. I found a CRT TV a month later, and extracted the
        flyback transformer. I drove it with a pretty weak driver, but I did a ZVS driver afterward.

        I finally started playing with MOTs. I have done some Jacobs's Ladder, Lichtenberg Figures, Tesla coils and I'm
        still not dead!
